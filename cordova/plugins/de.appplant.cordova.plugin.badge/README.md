}, false);
```

### Determine if the app does have the permission to show badge notifications

```

cordova.plugins.notification.badge.get(function (badge) {
	// console.log('badge number: ' + badge);
}, scope);
```

### Clear the badge number
The badge number can be removed through the `notification.badge.clear` interface.

#### Further informations

```

### Clear the badge number automatically if the user taps the app icon

```javascript
cordova.plugins.notification.badge.configure({ autoClear: Boolean });
```


##  Examples

### Set the badge number

```

### Clear the badge number automatically if the user taps the app icon
The code below tells the plugin to clear the badge each time the user taps the app icon.

```javascript

```


## Platform specifics
### Specify custom notification title on Android
The default format for the title is `%d new messages`, but is customizable through `configure`.

```javascript
cordova.plugins.notification.badge.configure({ title: '%d neue Meldungen' });
```

### Specify small icon on Android
As default the email icon is used, but is customizable through `configure`.

```javascript
cordova.plugins.notification.badge.configure({ smallIcon: 'icon' });
```

__Note:__ A small icon is required.


## Quirks
### App crashes on iOS
Please note that the plugin as well as cordova need to be compiled for each iOS version. The compiled iOS8 code will crash for example under iOS7.
